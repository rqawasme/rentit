# Rentit

Rentit is an Android application that allows users to rent their belongings and possessions to other people in their area. This allows everyone to be able to have a passive income, since you can use your unused possessions to generate income while still owning them. On the other hand, rentees will use this app who want a specific object for a temporary period or even to just test out. Another feature of the app is that you are able to post gigs. Gigs are jobs or tasks that you can hire someone to do. Anything from lawnmowing, to even car washing is possible through this app. 

## Pages 

Rentit features a Google maps home page which shows nearby listings in your area on the map, right when you open the app. You can move around in the app just like regular Google Maps, and click on listings that popup. 

Rentit also has a page for listings, as well as gigs, where you can search via a searchbar for the various categories of listings. This page will give you a gridview of various listings with important details on the listing card. By clicking on the cards, Rentit will show you the listing page, with details like whether its still available, the price, and description of the listing.

Rentit also has a "your listings" page with the various listings that you have listed actively.

Lastly, Rentit has a "Create Listing" page where you can enter in details and photos for your listing, and submit it.
